Page Flattener is a simple tool that helps when building flat html
pages. I generally use it when building a Pharmaceutical project,
where there are often many copy changes that happen across many pages.
In the case where that copy is in the header, and you've got 30 or more
pages, you'll have to make the same update 30 times and hope you don't 
make an error. Or do a search against the whole project and validate
the results of what should be a simple find/replace. Also not ideal.

With Page Flattener, you build out pages in PHP using simple includes 
to reference common page elements, and then automatically spit out the 
html files. When you need to make a copy change in the header, you simply 
update the file containing the header markup, flatten the project, and all 
your html files are updated instantly.

When you're ready to ZIP up the files for the client, you should re-format
the HTML. Any good text editor will do this automatically. I know that
Eclipse/Aptana and Komodo both have a reformat function.



USAGE

1. Check out 

http://icontfs.iconnicholson.com:8100/svn/Learning/trunk/tools/flattener

Note that the flattener will ONLY scan folders that are in the same directory as itself.
So if you're projects are in Xampp/htdocs, flattener should be checked out there.



2. Project structure

Page Flattener requires your project to have a folder called 'php' with a blank 
file named .flats in it. For example:

/myProject
	/assets
		/other
		/stuff
		/here
	/php
		.flats
		/tpl -> this could be named anything, as long as your include statements can find it

The 'php' folder must be in the main project dir (not assets/php). 


3. Building

To start building pages, start making .php files in the 'php' folder. Something
like index.php. Any pages that are found in the main 'php' folder will be transformed 
to html files in the main project directory. If you DON'T want a .php file ot be converted
to an html page, don't put it in the main 'php' folder.

For common elements across multiple pages (header, footer, whatever), 
make a sub-folderini the 'php' folder, name it something like tpl. Files in sub-folders are 
NOT converted to html pages.


4. Flatten
When you're ready to generate the HTML files, navigate your browser to:

http://localhost/checkedOutFolder

If you've followed the folder structure above, your project should appear in the
project drop down box on the left. Click the "flatten !" button and the pages will
appear in the pages pane.

That's basically it.



PHP example:

<?php

$page_header = "";
$page_title="BARACLUDE (entecavir) - Taking BARACLUDE&reg; (entecavir)";
$site_metta = "Learn why BARACLUDE is an effective chronic hepatitis B treatment option."; 

include('tpl/header.php'); 
?>
<div id="pallet">

		<?php include('tpl/topNav.php'); ?>
		<div id="hero">
